# Simple Speech Recognition with Python and AssemblyAI

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of speech recognition using Python and the AssemblyAI API. The goal is to convert spoken language into written text, leveraging AssemblyAI's powerful speech-to-text capabilities.

## Features
- **Speech to Text Conversion**: Converts spoken words into written text efficiently.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes AssemblyAI's speech-to-text API for accurate transcription.
- **File Processing**: Supports processing of audio files for transcription.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for scripting and integrating with the API.
- **AssemblyAI API**: A leading API for speech-to-text conversion.

## Setup and Installation
- Instructions on setting up the Python environment.
- Steps to obtain an API key from AssemblyAI and configure it within the project.
- Guidance on how to run the script with audio files.

## Usage
- In main.py change the file name to your audio file name and run the file through command line

# YouTube Video Transcriber: Python, AssemblyAI, and youtube-dl

## Introduction
This project is a Python-based application that leverages `youtube-dl` for downloading audio from YouTube videos and AssemblyAI for transcribing the downloaded audio into text. It provides an efficient way to extract spoken content from YouTube videos.

## Features
- **YouTube Audio Extraction**: Downloads audio from YouTube videos using `youtube-dl`.
- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Utilizes AssemblyAI's API to transcribe audio content into text.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple command-line interface for specifying the YouTube video URL and output preferences.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language for scripting and automation.
- **AssemblyAI API**: Provides accurate and fast speech-to-text conversion.
- **youtube-dl**: A command-line tool for downloading videos from YouTube and other video sites.

## Setup and Installation
- Steps to install Python and necessary dependencies.
- Instructions for setting up AssemblyAI API keys and `youtube-dl`.

## Usage
change the api key in api_secrets.py
change the youtube video url to anything you want in youtube_extractor.py

### Run this first
`pip install requests youtube_dl`
